# Iris Flower Classification

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Local file `IRIS.csv`
- **Features**:
  - sepal_length
  - sepal_width
  - petal_length
  - petal_width
- **Target**: species

## Project Steps
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Outlier detection
- Feature importance analysis
- Data scaling
- Model training and comparison:
  - Gaussian Naive Bayes
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix)
- Prediction on new data

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required libraries:  
   `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn`
3. Run the Python file or Jupyter Notebook.
4. Review the results and plots.

## Results
- The SVM model achieved the highest accuracy.
- Petal measurements (length and width) are the most important features.
